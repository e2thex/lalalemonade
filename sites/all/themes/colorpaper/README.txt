============

1.  Download the latest version of Color Paper theme for Drupal at
    http://drupal.org/project/colorpaper

2.  Unpack the downloaded file, place the entire colorpaper folder in your
    Drupal installation under any one of the following directory:

      sites/all/themes
        making it available to the default Drupal site and to all Drupal sites
        in a multi-site configuration
      sites/default/themes
        making it available to only the default Drupal site
      sites/example.com/themes
        making it available to only the example.com site if there is a
        sites/example.com/settings.php configuration file

3.  Log in as administrator on your Drupal site.
    Go to Administer > Site building > Themes (admin/build/themes) and set
    Color Paper as the default theme.

4.  Optionally choose from any one of the 5 colour variations:
    Green, Orange, Pink, Purple. The default colour scheme is Teal.

5.  You are done!

6.  If you have any further questions, theme customisation services, PSD to
    Drupal, just send me an e-mail with further details at ktleow@gmail.com

====================
Creating a text logo
====================

1.  I have included a PhotoShop template for you to create a text logo similar
    to the default Color Paper theme logo.

2.  This logo uses the font "DejaVu Sans" that can be downloaded free from
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu
    Download and install the font if you do not have it.

3.  Open the file logo.psd using PhotoShop.

4.  Use the Text tool and change the text of the logo. That layer is
    center-aligned by default.

5.  Save your new logo as logo.png and overwrite the default logo file.

6.  Done =)
