<p>This new module will contain the help files that have been injected, packaged in a way that is usable by the Advanced Help module.</p>
<p>The newly generated module will also have a generated module, written in PHP, that must be enabled, just like any other module. This generated module is needed for the help icons to be injected. </p>
<p>Thus the module name that is chosen for this field must be original, and should only contain lowercase letters and underscores (_).</p>
<p>If you are using HelpInject to generate help files for a module you maintain, the suggestion is to follow the pattern <code><em>yourmodulename_</em>help</code>.</p>
